Amazon Mechanical Turk SDK for PHP
===================
The goal of this SDK is to act as a wrapper for Amazon [Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/) API.

I'm making this to exercise myself with PHP autoloader, namespaces and some coding techniques in PHP.

This wrapper has its own entities and methods, and abstracts from Amazon API logic. The developer won't know how many calls will be placed or how they are structured.
It may be unnecessary, but as said this is an exercise for myself, and also I just liked to work with a more OOP approach to Amazon's MTurk API.

# Use
Check the [example file](example.php).

# To Do
This SDK is not complete at all, translating all the API actions into methods is a long process.

It will be helpful making tests too.

Please, feel free to make a pull request if you like this project and would like to add the missing pieces!
